### Create a repository from this template

* [Go to this repository page on Github](https://github.com/nicolas-van/bootstrap-4-github-pages).
* Click the `Star` button on the top right. (OK, this step is facultative, but that would make you a nice person)
* Click the `Use this template` button on the top right of the page.

### Modify the content

You probably don't want the present guide to be the front page of your website, so you should edit the `index.md` file. You probably also want to edit or delete the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` files.

Aside from that you can of course create new pages and posts like with any Jekyll website by refering to the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/).
